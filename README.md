# VBA-challenge
UCB Data Analytics-Challenge 2

CHALLENGE PURPOSE : In this challenge, the creation of VBA scripting is demonstrated to analyze generated stock market data. 

# References
This challenges dataset comprises two starter code Excel resource files: a) Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx and b) alphabetical_testing.xlsx. File "a" dataset was used as the primary file to demonstrate the creation of VBA scripts for this challenge. File "b" dataset is smaller and may be used to allow testing to run in a few seconds. 
File "a" dataset (Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) 

# Technologies Used: Excel and VBA Scripts Macros 

# Code
Source Code stored in this repo demonstrates the use of VBA script looping through one-quarter and runs successfully across all sheets (each quarter) : 

         a) the script loops through one-quarter of stock data and reads/ stores values from each row of the 
            following: ticker symbol, volume of stock, open price, and close price. 
         b) Columns are created for the ticker symbol, total volume, quarterly change, and percent change, in the same worksheet.
         c) Conditional formatting is applied to both the quarterly change and percent change columns.
         d) The script will calculate and display: 1) the greatest percentage increase, 2) greatest percentage 
            decrease, and 3) greatest total volume.

This file contains the ............: 

         a) Module1.bas: Script that will create, store, calculate, populate, format code items "a-c" ( as noted above) 
         b) Module2.bas: Script that will create, store, calculate, and populate code items "d" (as noted above)
